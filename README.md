# ANALYSIS

The analysis aims to build a deep learning model using a neural network for Alphabet Soup Charity. The goal is to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by the charity. The analysis involves preprocessing the data, designing the model, training, and evaluating its performance.

Results:

# Data Preprocessing:

Target Variable(s): The target variable is "IS_SUCCESSFUL," indicating if an applicant received funding (1) or not (0).

Feature Variable(s): All columns except "IS_SUCCESSFUL" are used as features to train the model.

Variables to be Removed: The "EIN" and "NAME" columns, used as identifiers, are removed from the input data.

# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:

Model Architecture: Specifics on neurons, layers, and activation functions are not given.

Target Model Performance: The model achieved around 72.98% accuracy on the test data, but the target performance is not mentioned.

Steps to Improve Performance: Hyperparameter optimization, varying neurons and layers, and feature scaling were used to enhance the model.

Summary:

The neural network achieved moderate success, with an accuracy of 72.98%, in predicting funding success for applicants. To improve performance, trying ensemble models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting could be a simpler and effective alternative. These models combine multiple decision trees to achieve better predictive capability. Hyperparameter tuning for the ensemble model could further enhance the analysis.
